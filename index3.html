                    "The knowledge and skills I gained from studying genetics and biotechnology have proven to be invaluable in the tech industry. My understanding of molecular genetics, genomics, and population genetics has given me a unique perspective when working on projects that involve genetic data. Additionally, my experience with biotechnological tools and techniques, such as genetic engineering and protein production, has been useful in understanding how to optimize processes in software development."
